                            I feel great. I am moving into a new apartment, the man I have been seeing for almost 7 months finally seems to be on the same page as me and work is somewhat good too. So I guess I am writing this just to clear my head on something, if you want to give your opinion I will gladly accept it.

                            Well, I have been seeing Diego for almost 7 months now, he has not asked me to be his girlfriend but should I really worry or is that a normal thing in today’s society? I have not had a somewhat relationship in a long time so I guess I forgot how those works. Also he talks about his ex a lot, if you are a guy who just got out of a super important relationship around 10 months ago, would you still be talking about your ex that much or is there something else I should worry about? Even sometimes, I feel like her shadow, like everything he and I do, he did it with her before.
                            
                            I guess today’s entry is a short one; it is my first one so it is kind of like ripping off a Band-Aid. Tomorrow is my 22nd birthday! I will try to write how it goes.
